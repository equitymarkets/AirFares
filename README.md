# Group Project 2

## Project Proposal

For this project will be pulling from two sources: yearly flight data and yearly ticket price information, both available in csv format, over a 15 year period. 

For the database we will be using NoSQL, or non-relational database specifically, MongoDB with PyMongo. 

We are looking to find out if there is a correlation between ticket prices and trips taken.
